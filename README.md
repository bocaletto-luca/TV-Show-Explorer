## Overview

**TV Show Explorer – Complete Edition** is a professional, full-featured web application that empowers users to explore TV shows through multiple discovery modes. This free application uses the TV Maze API to retrieve comprehensive data about TV shows—including cover images, summaries, cast details, and episodes—and provides advanced filtering features such as search by name, search by letter, filtering by genre, and a Top 100 Rated section complete with a top 10 horizontal bar chart. All interfaces are fully paginated, ensuring that large data sets are neatly organized and explored.

## Features

- **Search by Name:**  
  Users can enter a TV show name via a simple search form. The app then retrieves and displays all matching shows in a paginated grid.

- **Search by Letter:**  
  An A–Z horizontal menu lets users filter shows by the first letter of the show's name. Multiple pages are fetched to build a comprehensive dataset, and all results are paginated.

- **Filter by Genre:**  
  A dropdown menu provides a list of common genres. Selecting a genre fetches a broad set of shows from multiple pages, filters them by the chosen category, and displays the results with pagination.

- **Top 100 Rated:**  
  Users can view the top 100 rated TV shows sorted by rating. The app also displays a horizontal bar chart (using Chart.js) that visualizes the Top 10 rated shows with their titles and rating values.

- **Show Details Modal:**  
  Clicking on any show card opens a fullscreen modal that displays detailed information about the selected TV show (cover image, summary, cast list, and episodes grouped by season).

- **Enhanced Cover Display:**  
  The webapp ensures that cover images are shown in their entirety – using an increased container height and an `object-fit: contain` style – so that the full image is visible without being cropped.

- **Responsive & Modern Design:**  
  Built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5, the interface adapts beautifully to any device and screen size.

## Usage

1. **Navigation:**  
   A horizontal navigation menu at the top allows users to switch between the following modes:
   - **Search by Name**
   - **Search by Letter**
   - **Filter by Genre**
   - **Top 100 Rated**

2. **Search by Name:**  
   Enter a TV show name and click "Search". The matching shows are displayed in a paginated grid with complete cover images and brief summaries.

3. **Search by Letter:**  
   Click on any letter (A–Z) in the horizontal alphabet menu. The app will fetch a broad set of shows, filter by the selected letter (using the first character), and display all results with pagination.

4. **Filter by Genre:**  
   Select a genre from the dropdown menu and click "Filter". The app retrieves shows from multiple pages, filters by the chosen genre, and paginates the result set.

5. **Top 100 Rated:**  
   Click the "Load Top 100" button to view the highest rated TV shows. The results are paginated and – in addition – a horizontal bar chart displays the top 10 rated shows with their ratings.

6. **Detailed View:**  
   Clicking on any TV show card opens a fullscreen modal with detailed information about the show, including its summary, cast list, and episodes grouped by season.
